# Module 3: Javascript In The Browser - Forms

This is a return for the forms validation assignment.
The project can be seen live at [fruity-tomatoes.surge.sh](http://fruity-tomatoes.surge.sh)

There are 5 different types of input:
1. Text
2. E-mail
3. Selection with different options
4. A long textarea
5. A checkbox

All inputs have a HTML5 **required** attribute.
The Javascript overrides the default browser validation messages with in-browser styled error messages and adds a red outline to missed inputs.
When the form is fully completed, a success message is displayed.

The Javascript is explained with comments (no explanations in HTML and CSS files).
